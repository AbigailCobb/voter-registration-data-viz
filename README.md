## Introduction
Welcome! The purpose of this project is to use Python to visualize new voter registration by state. The data shows how many people registered to vote in early 2020 vs. early 2016 in 11 states and Washington, D.C. Data is available from January through April for all 12 of the jurisdictions, and data through May for four states and Washington D.C. This data is from the Center for Innovation and Research, and was used in [this report](https://electioninnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/New_Voter_Registrations.pdf). In addition, the data in [Florida](https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-reportsxlsx/), [Maryland](https://elections.maryland.gov/voter_registration/stats.html), [North Carolina](https://dl.ncsbe.gov/?prefix=data/voterstats/), [Virginia](https://www.elections.virginia.gov/resultsreports/registration-statistics/) and [Washington, D.C.](https://www.dcboe.org/Data-Resources-Forms/Request-Data), is publicly available.
